# ZachPrice-AtmMachine

The task given to us was to create a functioning ATM machine that had the basic functionality of depositing and withdrawing money. 

## How it works
When loaded, there is a dropdown box with 3 options, a blank option, Deposit and Withdraw. Deposit lets you deposit an amount and withdraw doing the opposite.
## Improvements
On withdraw, when you attempt to withdraw more than the current amount in your account balance it will send an alert saying that you have exceeded the available amount. The submit button will also be disabled when attempting to withdraw more than the available amount.
